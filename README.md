# 🎀 Ladies Bingo Game

A playful, satirical, and interactive web-based Bingo game exploring expectations placed on women — designed with intention, style, and accessibility in mind.

## ✨ Overview

Ladies Bingo is **not your typical Bingo game**. Instead of numbers, each square contains phrases and stereotypes often projected onto women — from fashion to lifestyle. The player is allowed a limited number of clicks to try and complete a winning Bingo pattern (row, column, or diagonal). The design intentionally prevents full-card wins, symbolizing the constraints and contradictions often faced in real life.

## 💡 Features

- 🎯 Interactive Bingo board with randomized, thematic phrases
- 🎨 Stylish UI with animations, sparkle effects, and feminine color palette
- 📱 Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 🎵 Background music, sound effects, and modals for win/lose feedback
- ♻️ “Play Again” functionality for replayability
- 🧠 Modular, scalable code following BEM naming convention

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** & **CSS3** (with media queries for responsiveness)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity
- **Web Audio API** for sound playback
- Optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
